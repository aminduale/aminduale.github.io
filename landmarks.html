            <h3>The Maasai Mara and Mount Kenya</h3>
            <p>Two of Kenya's most iconic landmarks, each with unique significance, are the Maasai Mara National Reserve and Mount Kenya.</p>
            <h4>Maasai Mara</h4>
            <p>The Maasai Mara National Reserve is a world-famous wildlife reserve located in southwestern Kenya, part of the larger Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. Known for its high concentration of wildlife, it's especially famous for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Great Migration</strong>: One of the “Seven Natural Wonders of Africa,” where over 1.5 million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles migrate annually from the Serengeti in Tanzania to the Maasai Mara, crossing the Mara River, where predators like crocodiles await.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Five</strong>: The reserve is home to the African "Big Five" (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, and rhinoceros) and many other species, making it one of the best locations for safari experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Maasai Culture</strong>: The Maasai people live in and around the Mara. They are known for their distinct dress, customs, and warrior culture, offering visitors a chance to learn about their traditional ways of life.</li>
            </ul>
